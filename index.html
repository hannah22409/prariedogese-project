          <strong>Prarie dogs,</strong> a species of rodent native to North
          America, live together in little villages of underground burrows. They
          are very social creatures, and when a predator enters their village ‚Äî
          most often a dog or a coyote or a hawk ‚Äî they call out to warn their
          neighbors. "It sounds kind of like

            ><em>'chee chee chee chee,'</em> "
          </a>
          says Slobodchikoff, a researcher on Prariedogese.
          <br />
          <br />
          Slobodchikoff and his students went out into the prairie dog villages,
          hid behind bushes, and stuck out their microphones whenever a human,
          or a dog, or a coyote, or a hawk passed through. They recorded calls
          that the prairie dogs made in response to different predators. Then he
          took his recordings to a lab and used a computer program to analyze
          the sounds.
          <br />
          <br />
          What Slobodchikoff discovered was that the calls clustered into
          different groups, and each cluster had its own signature set of
          frequencies and tones.
          <strong
            >Prairie dogs, in other words, don't just have a call for "danger" ‚Äî
            they have one
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47Fbo4kU2AU"
              target="_blank"
              class="secretLink"
              >call</a
            >
            for "human," another for "hawk" and a third for "coyote." They can
            even differentiate between coyotes and domesticated dogs.</strong
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          During his analysis,
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PBZy9j3H3I"
            target="_blank"
            class="secretLink"
            >Slobodchikoff</a
          >
          noticed something: Even though the human call was consistently
          different from the other calls, there was still significant variation
          between the individual human calls. He began to wonder whether the
          little rodents could possibly be describing their predators ‚Äî not just
          differentiating hawk from human, but actually saying something about
          the particular human or coyote or hawk that was approaching.
          <br />
          <br />
          So he devised a test. He had four (human) volunteers walk through a
          prairie dog village, and he dressed all the humans exactly the same ‚Äî
          except for their shirts. Each volunteer walked through the community
          four times: once in a blue shirt, once in a yellow, once in green and
          once in gray.
          <br />
          <br />
          He found, to his delight,
          <strong
            >that the calls broke down into groups based on the color of the
            volunteer's shirt.</strong
          >
          "I was astounded," says Slobodchikoff. But what astounded him even
          more, was that further analysis revealed that the calls also clustered
          based on other characteristics, like the height of the human.
          "Essentially they were saying, 'Here comes the tall human in the
          blue,' versus, 'Here comes the short human in the yellow,' " says
          Slobodchikoff.
